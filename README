Workspace for Collaborative Editing
-----------------------------------
Online Transcription Editor (OTE)

The WCE-OTE is written as a plugin for and distributed with a bundle of TinyMCE.

For WCE-OTE-specific license, information, and code,
see the wce-ote/ folder.

-----------------------------------

If obtaining source from repo, the tinymce bundle needs to be unzipped
to the root of the source distribution (this folder).  There is a Makefile to do this.
Simply type:

make

to clean things up again:

make clean

to build the distribution bundle, type:

make release
